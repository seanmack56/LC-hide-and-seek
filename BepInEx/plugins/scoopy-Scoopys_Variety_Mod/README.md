# Scoopy's Variety Mod (formerly LethalExtension)

## Overview

***This mod now requires LethalLevelLoader as a dependency***

Currently, the mod adds one new interior, which is dungeon themed, and some new scrap items. This interior is comprised of custom assets and is intended to add some variety to the interiors in the base game. 

The dungeon interior is in an almost complete state, with some bugs. There will likely be more content added to this dungeon in the near future, in addition to fixing some of the remaining issues.

The dungeon interior is a sprawling and dark crypt style interior with a high degree of verticality compared to the base interiors. 

If you encounter any bugs you'd like to report, please post them in the LethalExtension thread located in the "mod-releases" section of the Lethal Company modding discord (https://discord.com/servers/lethal-company-modding-1168655651455639582).
