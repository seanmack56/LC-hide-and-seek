# LethalExpansion

 This mod is an expansion project to add several settings and features, it come with an SDK to add new Scraps and Moons yourself.  
 [Github repository](https://github.com/HolographicWings/LethalExpansion)

 Features :
 - A mod menu with 28 settings to customize your game.
 - A support to load modules made with [my SDK](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/HolographicWings/LethalSDK/) to add new Scraps and Moons. (More soon)
 - A new Moon Catalogue ready for modded moons.
 - A Landmine extension to finally allow players to drop heavy items on them to avoid explosion, based on the weight of the items. (Disabled by default)
 - An optional automatic deadline system that increase the lenght of the expedition as much as the quota increase. (Disabled by default)
 - Added a space light to see the orbited planet though the ship camera.
 - A network system to synchronize your settings with the host.
 - Compatible with vanilla players. (Follow the "Vanilla Compatibility" section)
 - Settings to display the clock in 24H format and carried weight in KG.

# Looking for a successor !

### Looking for a successor to keep LethalExpansion and LethalSDK alife.

Hello, making this mod was an awesome adventure, but today i want to work on other projects and explore some game concept ideas to see if i can make my own game.
But i want deprecating this mod to be the last resort.
It's why i'm looking for someone interesting into continuing this mod and make it in his name.
If you are ever interested, invite me on discord with my username HolographicWings or write an issue either on LE or LSDK repositories.

Thanks you for supporting me during this project, i hope the LC modding will become even greater.
