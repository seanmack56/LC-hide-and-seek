# Infinite Emotes

Perfect for twerking off a ledge https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpD9i2i2faI

Loosens the CheckConditionsForEmotePatch to allow emoting while running and jumping and other states

## Config

There is a key (- by default or leftStickPress on controller) to stop emoting, emotes can also be stopped by crouching or interacting with things like ladders, terminal or 2 handed objects (unless those are turned on in the config)

Additional settings can be found in the cfg file to adjust when emotes are allowed, for example to only allow walking emoting instead of running

## Known gripes

- MoreEmotes changes walking speed on updates. So for emotes like griddy, prisyadka and sign the walking speed cannot be changed (i am trying to implement it in BetterEmotes but its time consuming)
- Emoting negates any animations so you wont see running animations etc
- Clicking the same emote button will not stop the emote, this is a limitation that is here to stay to allow for compatibility with MoreEmotes/BetterEmotes

## Changelog

Changelog can be found in the release section of the github repo (makes it easier for me to maintain it)
