### Added support for custom moon and fixed enemy pathing bugs

# The Scarlet Devil Mansion（紅魔館）

Adds the Scarlet Devil Mansion from Touhou as a possible dungeon for the snow moons (Dine, Rend, Tital). The chances are about 50% split between the regular mansion dungeon and this custom dungeon. You can edit the weight value in the config, synced by the host. If you'd like a cheap way to get there, we do happen to have a [mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Alice/MoonRoutePriceMod/) for just that.

The dungeon can also be enabled on any moon, vanilla or custom, in the config. I'm not responsible if the dungeon breaks on custom moons.

This is an alpha release. We are currently polishing up the rooms and adding unique dungeon mechanics, enemies, and items. We cannot guarantee stablity with other mods.

## Dungeon Features

The map is a grayscale representation of what the Scarlet Devil Mansion could look like, with a mayor starting room, hallway corriders, and typical mansion rooms (bedrooms, libraries, kitchens, etc.). The fire exit always leads to a garden.

This dungeon uses modified dungeon generation code to create three long paths (as opposed to the base game's single path), then creates branching paths like normal. Furthermore, the dungeon will always be confined to a relatively small box. Please understand that this will increase dungeon generation times (and may cause bugs).

## Enemies and Vents

Enemies will not spawn from vents but from demonic looking symbols on the ground. This is only a visual change.

  <b>The Knight</b>, a Coil-head variant

  Acts like a regular coil-head, but is noticeably slower and prefers spawning from statue props, especially ones passed by players.

## Roadmap

The development process is split into 3 distinct parts:

* Create more rooms, room variants, and polish up the current ones with props, lighting, etc.
* Add touhou-themed enemies and scrap items
* Add dungeon mechanics/features (for example the factory's appartatus and jumping puzzles)

There is a possibility that I add a custom moon, but that's way down the line.
