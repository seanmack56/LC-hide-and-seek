# Kazoo Mod
Adds a neat little kazoo to the game.

Wateridge can now be added back through [this mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/HolographicWings/LEDefaultModules/), so as a result I have moved Wateridge out of this mod so now it is purely, the Kazoo Mod.

The Kazoo Mod now works with either LethalExpansion or LethalExpansionCore installed, woohoo!
